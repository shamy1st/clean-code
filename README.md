# Clean Code
**Clean Code** is a code that any developer can read and change easily.

**Martin Fowler** "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."

### Why?
* **Maintainable Codebase**: clean code can help develop software that is easy to change and maintain.
* **Easier Troubleshooting**: clean code is easier to troubleshoot for problems.
* **Faster Onboarding**: a quicker onboarding for newcomers to keep productivity high.

### Characteristics
* **Focused**: code should be written to solve a specific problem.
* **Simple**: design and implementation must be as simple as possible.
* **Testable**: easy to test the codebase, preferably in an automated manner.
